This is a repository for my Complex Analysis project. It is not a programming project, but a textbook project written in MicTex. It is an attempt to learn more about complex analysis, by writing proofs using symbolic locic and predicate logic more specifically.

I don't expect much help with this, but any comments and suggestions are welcome.
